# Practice-BachelorWorkStart
Here at this branch I will show a part of what I have been developing for my bachelor work during the practice time!

So, let me present you what I have been working on lately. This is a web application for the park of attraction. Idea of it is to be a navigator, which consists of ticket buying system, having offer for food and so on. Additionally, I have created a so-called admin panel, which could show some statistic of the park system.

So, let's begin with the admin panel, that allows us to add things, that the members can have it in the cars later. But firtsly, we have to login there. Our admin is called Elias, therefore, he is entering by his name and password

Then, we can manage some staff. We can managed our rides good staff, their price, photo and so on. I will show one example, and it will become understandable at once.

So, we clicked that button and can edit staff, for example update price for it. We click the button update, and move to the form. Let's change the price and photo of it.

After that, we update the information there by clicking the "Update" button. And here is our ride. We can check it by the name.
